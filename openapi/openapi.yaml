    ## Access to the API


    If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the
    following endpoints:


    | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |

    |-------------------------|-------------------------|

    |US Cloud 1 Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com  |

    |US Cloud 1 API Sandbox |  https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |

    |US Cloud 2 Production | https://rest.zuora.com |

    |US Cloud 2 API Sandbox | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|

    |US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |  

    |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |

    |US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a
    href="http://support.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> to
    enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST
    endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service)
    Environment for existing and new
    customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611)
    for more information. |

    |EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |

    |EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |

    |EU Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |


    The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox
    tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If
    you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your
    Zuora representative for assistance.



    If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a
    href="https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive"
    target="_blank">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign
    up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data,
    including a sample product catalog.



    # Error Handling


    If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1`
    (except
    [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/tag/Actions)
    and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error
    code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the
    error.


    The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error
    code and message pair:


    ```
     {
       "success": false,
       "processId": "CBCFED6580B4E076",
       "reasons":  [
         {
          "code": 53100320,
          "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
         }
        ]
     }
    ```

    The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The
    `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora
    Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.


    The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The
    error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue
    that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing, Collect, and
    Central Platform. For example, `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is
    specified for the `termType` field of the `subscription` object.


    The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an
    authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other
    unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011`
    indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 


    When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two
    components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the
    following Zuora error code sample:


    <a href="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg"
    target="_blank"><img
    src="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg"
    alt="Zuora Error Code Sample"></a>



    **Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload.
    Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you
    will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object
    and an unknown field. 

    The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules
    described in the [Error Category
    Codes](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/overview/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Codes)
    section. 

    In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.



    ## REST API Resource Codes


    The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field
    of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example,
    `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 


    The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to
    `679999`. See <a
    href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes"
    target="_blank">Resource Codes</a> in the Knowledge Center for a full list
    of resource codes.


    ## Error Category Codes


    The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example,
    resource not found or missing required field. 


    The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding
    resolution:


    | Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |

    |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|

    | 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed
    because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing

    unknown field in the request body. |

    | 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed
    because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing
    field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required
    fields in the request body. |

    | 23      | Missing required parameter  | The request cannot be processed
    because a required query parameter is missing. | Check the missing parameter
    name in the response message, and ensure that you include the parameter in
    the query. |

    | 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed
    due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message
    and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |

    | 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be
    found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource
    exists in your Zuora tenant. |

    | 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not
    support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the
    endpoint and method matches. |

    | 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed
    because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by
    another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the
    request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs,
    contact <a href="https://support.zuora.com" target="_blank">Zuora Global
    Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response
    header for assistance.</p> |

    | 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal
    error. | Contact <a href="https://support.zuora.com" target="_blank">Zuora
    Global Support</a> with the returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the
    response header for assistance. |

    | 61      | Temporary error             | A temporary error occurs during
    request processing, for example, a database communication error. |
    <p>Resubmit the request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error
    still occurs, contact <a href="https://support.zuora.com"
    target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> with the returned

    | 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent
    requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request
    after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the
    response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request
    limits](https://www.zuora.com/developer/rest-api/general-concepts/rate-concurrency-limits/)
    for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |

    | 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed
    due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body
    and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |

    | 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error
    when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway,
    tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action
    accordingly. |



    # API Versions


    The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora
    REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor
    version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST
    request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the
    API.


    ## Major Version


    The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently,
    Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST
    https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.


    ## Minor Version


    Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For
    example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to
    replace it. 


    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a
    field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all
    minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in
    version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request
    header to process without an error. 


    If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version
    or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field
    with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions.
    For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is
    in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use
    this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.


    If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported,
    Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API
    documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we
    note that in the field description.


    You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require
    a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version`
    parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request
    call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you
    want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the 
    `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The
    `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.


    For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not
    specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of
    the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 


    ### Minor Version History


    The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the
    changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.


    The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a
    Zuora REST API minor version.

  - name: Actions
    description: >
      Actions are operations that are batch in nature. For example, the
      "create", "update", "delete", and other operations allow changes to up-to
      50 objects at a time. The "query" operation will return up-to 2000 result
      records back at a time, before requiring additional pages of data to be
      returned via a subsequent "queryMore" operation.


      The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. If you want to change the WSDL
      version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL
      version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API
      Version
      History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).


      **Note**: Actions do not support the Invoice Settlement feature. This
      feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice
      Item Settlement. Actions also do not support the Orders feature.
  - name: Accounting Codes
    description: >
      Accounting Codes are commonly referred to as General Ledger Accounts or
      General Ledger Account Codes. In Zuora, the use of accounting codes are
      optional but recommended. 


      This section contains the operations that allow you to create, update,
      get, delete, activate, or deactivate accounting codes in Zuora.
  - name: Accounting Periods
    description: >
      A key step in configuring Finance is to create accounting periods in Zuora
      to match your company's financial calendar. 

      This allows Zuora to produce reports and data exports organized by
      accounting periods, and to perform the work of closing the accounting
      periods for the revenue sub-ledger.
  - name: Accounts
    description: >
      Some operations in this section are similar to each other, but are
      provided for different use scenarios. You should choose the one that best
      suits your needs.


      For example, the [Create
      account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_Account)
      operation is used to create an account with a credit card payment method,
      a bill-to contact, and optionally an sold-to contact or an associated
      subscription. If you want to create an account without creating any
      associated objects such as subscriptions, use [CRUD: Create
      Account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Object_POSTAccount)
      instead.


      If you want to create an account and the associated subscription at the
      same time without providing credit card information, use the
      [Subscribe](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Action_POSTsubscribe)
      action.
  - name: Amendments
    description: >
      You can use amendments to modify subscriptions. However, Zuora recommends
      you to use [Update
      subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/PUT_Subscription)
      (recommended) or
      [Amend](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Action_POSTamend)
      to do so.
  - name: Attachments
    description: >
      Use attachments in Zuora to upload documents of various formats to

  - name: Invoice Adjustments
    description: >
      An invoice adjustment modifies an existing invoice. You use an invoice
      adjustment to change the entire invoice. For example, you can apply a late
      fee to the invoice balance.


      An invoice adjustment differs from an invoice item adjustment. An invoice
      item adjustment affects an individual charge or line item on an invoice.
      An invoice adjustment affects the invoice at the header-level.


      **Note**: Invoice Adjustment is deprecated on Production in WSDL version
      64.0. Zuora recommends that you use the Invoice Item Adjustment to adjust
      invoices. If you have the <a
      href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement"
      target="_blank">Invoice Settlement</a> feature enabled, this object is
      deprecated and only available for backward compatibility.
  - name: Invoice Item Adjustments
    description: >
      Invoice item adjustments allow you to adjust the invoice details,
      including taxes at the charge level, and have those adjustments reported
      in the system under the same accounting code as the items that are being
      adjusted.


      **Note**: The <a
      href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement"
      target="_blank">Invoice Settlement</a> feature is a replacement for
      Invoice Item Adjustments. We recommend that you enable Invoice Settlement

    description: >
      Gateway reconciliation is the process of verifying that the electronic
      payment and refund transactions processed in Zuora match the transactions
      reported by the gateway. 

      For example, if Zuora processed 200 transactions through a gateway, you
      should see the same number of transactions on the gateway's reconciliation
      report, sometimes also called the settlement report.

  - name: Product Rate Plan Charges
    description: >
      A product rate plan charge represents a charge model or a set of fees
      associated with a product rate plan, which is the part of a product that
      your customers subscribe to. Each product rate plan can have multiple
      product rate plan charges.


      Product rate plan charges can be of three types: one-time fees, recurring
      fees, and usage fees. For example, the $50 activation fee for the Topaz
      product rate plan is a one-time product rate plan charge.
  - name: Product Rate Plans
    description: >
      A product rate plan is the part of a product that your customers subscribe
      to. Each product can have multiple product rate plans, and each product
      rate plan can have multiple product rate plan charges, which are fees for
      products and their product rate plans.
  - name: Products
    description: >
      A product is an item or service that your company sells. In the
      subscription economy, a product is generally a service that your customers
      subscribe to rather than a physical item that they purchase one time. For
      example, customers subscribe to a service that provides them a car when
      and where they need a car rather than buying a car outright.


      A Product object contains all of the items in a specific product,
      especially product rate plans and product rate plan charges. Each Product
      object can have multiple rate plans, which in turn can each have multiple
      rate plan charges. Each rate plan charge can have multiple tiers. Taken
      together, all of these items create a single product.


      Customers subscribe to products that are in your product catalog. Product
      objects collectively compose your product catalog. You create your product
      catalog by creating products. As soon as you create your first product,
      you create your product catalog.

  - name: Rate Plan Charge Tiers
    description: >
      A rate plan charge tier is part of a subscription or an amendment to a
      subscription, and it comes from a product rate plan charge tier. A rate
      plan charge tier holds the prices for a rate plan charge. Each rate plan
      charge has at least one tier associated with it.


      Rate plan charge tiers are sometimes called subscription rate plan charge
      tiers to distinguish them from product rate plan charge tiers. 

      Rate plan charge tiers that are part of an amendment are sometimes called
      amendment rate plan charge tiers for the same reason. However, the object
      name is RatePlanChargeTier, not SubscriptionRatePlanChargeTier nor
      AmendmentRatePlanChargeTier: these latter two names don't exist.

      the quantity measures. 


      You can customize the units of measure (UOM) your company uses to measure
      the use of your services; for example, minutes, people, seats, and
      licenses can all be units of measure.
  - name: Usage
    description: >
      Consumption of a billable service or resource (such as database storage
      space or bundles of emails sent) provides the basis for some charge models
      - simple usage, tiered pricing, or volume pricing. 

      To make this work, usage must be tracked in the system and usage charges
      must be calculated and invoiced. 

      Usage is always billed in arrears - for example, you might bill customers
      in February for their January usage. Usage can be billed on a recurring

      A workflow is a sequence of tasks that are performed based on predefined

      series of complex tasks that otherwise need to be performed manually and
      repetitively.
