  Information about an order action of type `addProduct`. 


  If you want to create a pending order through the "Add product" order action,
  and if the charge's trigger condition is `Specific Date`, you must set a
  charge number in the `chargeNumber` field for the "Add product" order action.
  In this case, if you do not set it, Zuora will not generate the charge number
  for you.


  See more information about pending orders in [Pending Order and
  Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/Pending_Order_and_Subscription).

  externalCatalogPlanId:
    description: >
      An external ID of the product rate plan to be added. You can use this
      field to specify a product rate plan that is imported from an external
      system. The value of the `externalCatalogPlanId` field must match one of
      the values that are predefined in the `externallyManagedPlanIds` field on
      a product rate plan.


      **Note:** If both `externalCatalogPlanId` and `productRatePlanId` are
      provided. They must point to the same product rate plan. Otherwise, the
      request would fail.

  externallyManagedPlanId:
    description: >
      Indicates the unique identifier for the rate plan purchased on a
      third-party store. This field is used to represent a subscription rate

      List of features associated with the rate plan.

      The system compares the `subscriptionProductFeatures` and `featureId`
      fields in the request with the counterpart fields in a rate plan. The
      comparison results are as follows:

      * If there is no `subscriptionProductFeatures` field or the field is
      empty, features in the rate plan remain unchanged. But if the
      `clearingExistingFeatures` field is additionally set to true, all features
      in the rate plan are cleared.

      * If the `subscriptionProductFeatures` field contains the `featureId`
      nested fields, as well as the optional `description` and `customFields`
      nested fields, the features indicated by the featureId nested fields in
      the request overwrite all features in the rate plan.

  uniqueToken:
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the rate plan. This identifier enables you to refer
      to the rate plan before the rate plan has an internal identifier in Zuora.


      For instance, suppose that you want to use a single order to add a product
      to a subscription and later update the same product. When you add the
      product, you can set a unique identifier for the rate plan. Then when you
      update the product, you can use the same unique identifier to specify
      which rate plan to modify.
