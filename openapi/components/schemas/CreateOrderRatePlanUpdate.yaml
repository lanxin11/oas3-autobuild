  clearingExistingFeatures:

      Specifies whether all features in the rate plan will be cleared.

  externalCatalogPlanId:
    description: >
      An external ID of the rate plan to be updated. You can use this field to
      specify an existing rate plan in your subscription. The value of the
      `externalCatalogPlanId` field must match one of the values that are
      predefined in the `externallyManagedPlanIds` field on a product rate plan.
      However, if there are multiple rate plans with the same
      `productRatePlanId` value existing in the subscription, you must use the
      `ratePlanId` field to update the rate plan. The `externalCatalogPlanId`
      field cannot be used to distinguish multiple rate plans in this case.


      **Note:** If both `externalCatalogPlanId` and `ratePlanId` are provided.
      They must point to the same product rate plan. Otherwise, the request
      would fail.
    type: string
  ratePlanId:
    description: >
      The id of the rate plan to be updated. It can be the latest version or any
      history version id.
    type: string
  specificUpdateDate:
    description: >

      The date when the Update Product order action takes effect. This field is
      only applicable if there is already a future-dated Update Product order
      action on the subscription. The format of the date is yyyy-mm-dd.


      See [Update a Product on Subscription with Future-dated
      Updates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/C_Update_a_Product_in_a_Subscription/Update_a_Product_on_Subscription_with_Future-dated_Updates)

  subscriptionProductFeatures:
    description: >
      List of features associated with the rate plan.

      The system compares the `subscriptionProductFeatures` and `featureId`
      fields in the request with the counterpart fields in a rate plan. The
      comparison results are as follows:

      * If there is no `subscriptionProductFeatures` field or the field is
      empty, features in the rate plan remain unchanged. But if the
      `clearingExistingFeatures` field is additionally set to true, all features
      in the rate plan are cleared.

      * If the `subscriptionProductFeatures` field contains the `featureId`
      nested fields, as well as the optional `description` and `customFields`
      nested fields, the features indicated by the featureId nested fields in
      the request overwrite all features in the rate plan.

  uniqueToken:
    description: >
      A unique string to represent the rate plan in the order. The unique token
      is used to perform multiple actions against a newly added rate plan. For
      example, if you want to add and update a product in the same order, assign
      a unique token to the newly added rate plan and use that token in future
      order actions.
