  externalCatalogPlanId:
    description: >
      An external ID of the product rate plan to be added. You can use this
      field to specify a product rate plan that is imported from an external
      system. The value of the `externalCatalogPlanId` field must match one of
      the values that are predefined in the `externallyManagedPlanIds` field on
      a product rate plan.


      **Note:** If both `externalCatalogPlanId` and `productRatePlanId` are
      provided. They must point to the same product rate plan. Otherwise, the
      request would fail.

    type: string
  uniqueToken:
    description: >
      Unique identifier for the rate plan. This identifier enables you to refer
      to the rate plan before the rate plan has an internal identifier in Zuora.


      For instance, suppose that you want to use a single order to add a product
      to a subscription and later update the same product. When you add the
      product, you can set a unique identifier for the rate plan. Then when you
      update the product, you can use the same unique identifier to specify
      which rate plan to modify.
