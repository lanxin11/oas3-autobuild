      amountWithoutTax:
        description: >
          The calculated gross amount for an order line item excluding tax. If
          the tax mode is tax exclusive, the value of this field equals that of
          the `amount` field.


          If the tax mode of an order line item is not set, the system treats it
          as tax exclusive by default. The value of the `amountWithoutTax` field
          equals that of the `amount` field.


          If you create an order line item from the product catalog, the tax
          mode and tax code of the product rate plan charge are used for the
          order line item by default. You can still overwrite this default
          set-up by setting the tax mode and tax code of the order line item.
