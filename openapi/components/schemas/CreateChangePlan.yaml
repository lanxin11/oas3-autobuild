  Information about an order action of type `changePlan`. 


  Use the change plan type of order action to replace the existing rate plans in
  a subscription with other rate plans.


  **Note**: The change plan type of order action is in the **Early Adopter**
  phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters
  before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early
  adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global
  Support](http://support.zuora.com/).


  If you want to create a pending order through the "change plan" order action,
  and if the charge's trigger condition is `Specific Date`, you must set a
  charge number in the `chargeNumber` field for the "change plan" order action.
  In this case, if you do not set it, Zuora will not generate the charge number
  for you.


  See more information about pending orders in [Pending Order and
  Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/Pending_Order_and_Subscription).

  effectivePolicy:
    description: >
      * If the rate plan change (from old to new) is an upgrade, the effective
      policy is `EffectiveImmediately` by default.

      * If the rate plan change (from old to new) is a downgrade, the effective
      policy is `EffectiveEndOfBillingPeriod` by default.

      * Otherwise, the effective policy is `SpecificDate` by default.

      However, if you do not set this field, the field will be automatically
      generated by the system according to the following rules:


      When the old and new rate plans are within the same Grading catalog group:

      * If the grade of new plan is greater than that of the old plan, this is
      an "Upgrade".

      * If the grade of new plan is less than that of the old plan, this is a
      "Downgrade".

      * If the grade of new plan equals that of the old plan, this is a
      "Crossgrade".


      When the old and new rate plans are not in the same Grading catalog group,
      or either has no group, this is "PlanChanged".
    enum:
      - Upgrade
      - Downgrade
      - Crossgrade
      - PlanChanged
