  Information about an order action of type `RemoveProduct`.
properties:
  externalCatalogPlanId:
    description: >
      An external ID of the rate plan to be removed. You can use this field to
      specify an existing rate plan in your subscription. The value of the
      `externalCatalogPlanId` field must match one of the values that are
      predefined in the `externallyManagedPlanIds` field on a product rate plan.
      However, if there are multiple rate plans with the same
      `productRatePlanId` value existing in the subscription, you must use the
      `ratePlanId` field to remove the rate plan. The `externalCatalogPlanId`
      field cannot be used to distinguish multiple rate plans in this case.


      **Note:** If both `externalCatalogPlanId` and `ratePlanId` are provided.
      They must point to the same product rate plan. Otherwise, the request
      would fail.
