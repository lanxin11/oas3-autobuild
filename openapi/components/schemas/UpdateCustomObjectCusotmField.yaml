      Indicates whether the field is filterable or not. Applicable to `addField`
      and `updateField` actions.


      You can change a filterable field to non-filterable and vice versa. You
      can also add a filterable field. One custom object can have a maximum of
      10 filterable fields.


      Note that changing filterable fields triggers reindexing. It will take
      12-24 hours before all your data are reindexed and available to query.

      Indicates whether the field is required or optional.


      You can update a required field to optional. On the other hand, you can
      only update an optional field to required on the custom object with no
      records.


      You can only add a required field to the custom object with no records.

  unique:
    description: >
      Indicates whether to specify a unique constraint to the field. You can
      remove the unique constraint on the field. However, you can only add a
      unique constraint to a filterable field if the custom object contains no
      record. One custom object can have a maximum of 5 fields with unique
      constraints.
