      List of features associated with the rate plan.

      The system compares the `subscriptionProductFeatures` and `featureId`
      fields in the request with the counterpart fields in a rate plan. The
      comparison results are as follows:

      * If there is no `subscriptionProductFeatures` field or the field is
      empty, features in the rate plan remain unchanged. But if the
      `clearingExistingFeatures` field is additionally set to true, all features
      in the rate plan are cleared.

      * If the `subscriptionProductFeatures` field contains the `featureId`
      nested fields, as well as the optional `description` and `customFields`
      nested fields, the features indicated by the featureId nested fields in
      the request overwrite all features in the rate plan.

  uniqueToken:
    description: >
      A unique string to represent the rate plan in the order. The unique token
      is used to perform multiple actions against a newly added rate plan. For
      example, if you want to add and update a product in the same order, assign
      a unique token to the newly added rate plan and use that token in future
      order actions.
