      If the service activation date is set as a required field in Default
      Subscription Settings, skipping this field in a `CreateSubscription` order
      action of your JSON request will result in a `Pending` order and a
      `Pending Activation` subscription.


      If the customer acceptance date is set as a required field in Default
      Subscription Settings, skipping this field in a `CreateSubscription` order
      action of your JSON request will result in a `Pending` order and a
      `Pending Acceptance` subscription. If the service activation date field is
      at the same time required and skipped (or set as null), it will be a
      `Pending Activation` subscription.

      Type of order action.


      Unless the type of order action is `RenewSubscription`, you must use the
      corresponding field to provide information about the order action. For
      example, if the type of order action is `AddProduct`, you must set the
      `addProduct` field.


      Zuora returns an error if you set a field that corresponds to a different
      type of order action. For example, if the type of order action is
      `AddProduct`, Zuora returns an error if you set the `updateProduct` field.


      **Note**: The change plan type of order action is in the **Early Adopter**
      phase. We are actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early
      adopters before releasing it as generally available. If you want to join
      this early adopter program, submit a request at [Zuora Global
