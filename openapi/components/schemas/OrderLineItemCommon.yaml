      You can update this field only for a sale OLI and only when the sale OLI

      Use this field in accordance with the `inlineDiscountType` field, in the
      following manner:

      * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `Percentage`, this field
      specifies the discount percentage for each unit of the order line item.
      For exmaple, if you specify `5` in this field, the discount percentage is
      5%.

      * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `FixedAmount`, this field
      specifies the discount amount on each unit of the order line item. For
      exmaple, if you specify `10` in this field, the discount amount on each
      unit of the order line item is 10.


      Once you set the `inlineDiscountType`, `inlineDiscountPerUnit`, and
      `listPricePerUnit` fields, the system will automatically generate the
      `amountPerUnit` field. You shall not set the `amountPerUnit` field by
      yourself.
