      You can update this field for an OLI only when the OLI is in the

      Use this field in accordance with the `inlineDiscountType` field, in the
      following manner:

      * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `Percentage`, this field
      specifies the discount percentage for each unit of the order line item.
      For exmaple, if you specify `5` in this field, the discount percentage is
      5%.

      * If the `inlineDiscountType` field is set as `FixedAmount`, this field
      specifies the discount amount on each unit of the order line item. For
      exmaple, if you specify `10` in this field, the discount amount on each
      unit of the order line item is 10.


      Once you set the `inlineDiscountType`, `inlineDiscountPerUnit`, and
      `listPricePerUnit` fields, the system will automatically generate the
      `amountPerUnit` field. You shall not set the `amountPerUnit` field by
      yourself.

      You can update this field for an OLI only when the OLI is in the

      Use this field to specify the inline discount type, which can be
      `Percentage`, `FixedAmount`, or `None`. The default value is `Percentage`.


      Use this field together with the `inlineDiscountPerUnit` field to specify
      inline discounts for order line items. The inline discount is applied to
      the list price of an order line item. 


      Once you set the `inlineDiscountType`, `inlineDiscountPerUnit`, and
      `listPricePerUnit` fields, the system will automatically generate the
      `amountPerUnit` field. You shall not set the `amountPerUnit` field by
      yourself.
