      However, if you do not set this field, the field will be automatically
      generated by the system according to the following rules:


      When the old and new rate plans are within the same Grading catalog group:

      * If the grade of new plan is greater than that of the old plan, this is
      an "Upgrade".

      * If the grade of new plan is less than that of the old plan, this is a
      "Downgrade".

      * If the grade of new plan equals that of the old plan, this is a
      "Crossgrade".


      When the old and new rate plans are not in the same Grading catalog group,
      or either has no group, this is "PlanChanged".
    enum:
      - Upgrade
      - Downgrade
      - Crossgrade
      - PlanChanged
