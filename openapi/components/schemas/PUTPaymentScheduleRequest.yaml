            - If "existing `occurrences` > updated `occurrences` >= the number of `processed`/`errored`/`canceled` payment schedule items", the following number of pending items will be removed by descending order of the schedule dates: "existing `occurrences` - updated `occurrences`".
            - If "updated `occurrences` < the number of `processed`/`erroed`/`canceled` payment schedule items", a validation error will be returned.
