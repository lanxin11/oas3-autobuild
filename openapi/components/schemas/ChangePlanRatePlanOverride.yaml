      The system compares the `subscriptionProductFeatures` and `featureId`
      fields in the request with the counterpart fields in a rate plan. The
      comparison results are as follows:

      * If there is no `subscriptionProductFeatures` field or the field is
      empty, features in the rate plan remain unchanged. But if the
      `clearingExistingFeatures` field is additionally set to true, all features
      in the rate plan are cleared.

      * If the `subscriptionProductFeatures` field contains the `featureId`
      nested fields, as well as the optional `description` and `customFields`
      nested fields, the features indicated by the featureId nested fields in
      the request overwrite all features in the rate plan.

      For instance, suppose that you want to use a single order to add a product
      to a subscription and later update the same product. When you add the
      product, you can set a unique identifier for the rate plan. Then when you
      update the product, you can use the same unique identifier to specify
      which rate plan to modify.
