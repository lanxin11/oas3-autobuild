    Creates multiple payment schedules at once. You can create both recurring
    payment schedules and custom payment schedules in one request. The maximum
    number of payment schedules that can be created by a single request is 50.
    The maximum number of payment schedule items that each payment schedule can
    contain is 1000, i.e., you must specify less than 1000 items for a custom
    payment schedule, and the `occurrences` field must be less than 1000 for a
    recurring payment schedule.


    **Note:**

    - The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are
    actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before
    releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter
    program, submit a request at [Zuora Global
    Support](https://support.zuora.com/).

    - This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled.

    - If Standalone Payment is enabled, you can choose to use payment schedules
    to process payments associated with billing documents, standalone payments,
    or unapplied payments. If Standalone Payment is not enabled, you can only
    use payment schedules to process unapplied payments or payments associated
    with billing documents.

    - This operation is version controlled. If you set `zuora-version` to
    `329.0`, when creating custom payment schedules associated with billing
    documents, you need to specify the billing document for each payment
    schedule item; If `zuora-version` is set to `330.0`, when creating custom
    payment schedules associated with billing documents, you only need to
    specify the billing documents at the payment schedule level. The default
    version number is `329.0`. However, we recommend that you specify the
    version to `330.0`. `329.0` will be deprecated soon.
