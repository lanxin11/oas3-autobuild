    Skips a payment schedule item by ID. The skipped payment schedule item will
    turn to the `canceled` status, and a new item will be scheduled on the next
    recurring date after the last existing scheduled date.


    **Note:**

    - Only payment schedule items in recurring payment schedules can be skipped,
    and the item must be in the `pending` status.

    - The Payment Schedules feature is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are
    actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before
    releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early adopter
    program, submit a request at [Zuora Global
    Support](https://support.zuora.com/).

    - This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled.
