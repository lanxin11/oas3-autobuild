    Enables you to authorize the availability of funds for a transaction but
    delay the capture of funds until a later time. Subsequently, use [CRUD:
    Create a
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Object_POSTPayment)
    or [Create a
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CreatePayment)
    to capture the authorized funds, or use [Cancel
    authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/POST_CancelAuthorization)
    to cancel the authorization.

    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-references/api/operation/Object_POSTPayment)
